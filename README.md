# Hi there, I'm Benjamin üëã

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. Besides the web, I am seeing myself later focusing more on mobile development, as well as diving deep into Cloud Computing. In this fast-changing world, I believe cloud computing is one of the most fascinating and promising fields in the industry. Combined with the power of AI, I am very positive about the incredible things it can achieve.
